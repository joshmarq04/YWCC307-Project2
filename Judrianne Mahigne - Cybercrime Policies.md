# üõ°Ô∏è Generative AI Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope

**Objective**:  
Establish guidelines to prevent the misuse of Generative AI (GenAI) tools in facilitating cybercriminal activities, such as phishing, malware creation, or unauthorized data manipulation.

**Applicability**:  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party affiliates who access or utilize GenAI tools within the organization's network or on its behalf.

---

## 2. Acceptable Use Policy

### Permitted Uses:
- Utilizing GenAI for tasks like drafting non-sensitive communications, generating code snippets for internal tools, or summarizing publicly available information.

### Prohibited Uses:
- Inputting confidential, proprietary, or personally identifiable information (PII) into GenAI platforms.
- Using GenAI to create or disseminate malicious software, phishing content, or any material intended for fraudulent activities.
- Employing GenAI outputs without proper verification, especially in contexts that could impact decision-making or external communications.

---

## 3. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **Data Classification**:  
  Implement a data classification scheme to identify and label sensitive information, ensuring it's not inadvertently exposed to GenAI tools.

- **Tool Vetting**:  
  Maintain a list of approved GenAI tools that have been evaluated for security compliance.

- **Monitoring and Logging**:  
  Establish monitoring mechanisms to track GenAI usage, detect anomalies, and ensure adherence to the policy.

---

## 4. Preventive Policy Measures

To proactively defend against the misuse of GenAI in cybercrime:

- **Prompt and Output Review**:  
  Automatically log and periodically review GenAI prompts and generated content to detect potentially dangerous or non-compliant usage.

- **Network Segmentation**:  
  Isolate GenAI tools from systems processing sensitive data to reduce exposure risks.

- **Malicious Pattern Detection**:  
  Integrate threat detection systems that flag common patterns associated with AI-generated phishing, social engineering, or malware scripts.

- **Red Team Simulation**:  
  Conduct simulated attacks using GenAI to test internal controls and train staff on identifying AI-driven threats.

---

## 5. Training and Awareness

- **Employee Education**:  
  Conduct regular training sessions to inform staff about the risks associated with GenAI, including potential cyber threats and data privacy concerns.

- **Incident Reporting**:  
  Create clear channels for reporting suspected misuse of GenAI tools or breaches of this policy.

---

## 6. Compliance and Enforcement

- **Auditing**:  
  Perform periodic audits to assess compliance with the GenAI policy and identify areas for improvement.

- **Disciplinary Actions**:  
  Outline consequences for violations, which may include revocation of access privileges, disciplinary measures, or legal action, depending on the severity of the breach.
